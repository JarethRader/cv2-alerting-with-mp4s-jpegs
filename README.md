# cv2-alerting-with-mp4s-jpegs
This is an alerting system to be a "for free" (both beer and liberty) version of a commercial alerting systems.  Recording starts when motion is detected.  Recording stops when motion ends.  There are options for scaling and tweaking the detection.

We have a system for coalesscing alerts to a single server or sending them via email or another transport.  Soon to be added.

As usual, you are on your own!
